Weapon Gacha
Weapon gacha will be separate component from the character gacha. (possibly new currency introduced...?)
Each weapon has passive, basic attack and 2 abilities and can skip turn.
5 slots in combat
You can make prebuilt decks and play blind pick or draft pick where you take turn drafting weapons.

Once weapon gacha is activated on a card, it cannot be sold and will be charred, with the exception of low rarities which can be burnt lel.
It'll be possible to use karma to reroll the weapon on a card.

physical damage, most common, can be dodged, blocked, reduced by armour and crit.
magic damage, can't be dodged, blocked or reduced by armour but does flat damage without crit chance, and often requires cooldown and smaller in damage value.

border uses the rarity colours

if it's gif or custom image use image 1 unfortunately.
if no image is found uh why did you use this character ffs...

weapon rarity system
Stars system nah
Rare, Epic, Legendary
Rarities don't change the effectiveness, but how flexible they are and powerlevels when you get the perfect combos.
Rares are flexible, epics enable specific comps, legendaries require specific comps to be effective, but can be countered.
