Burn changes
Gem reward will be replaced with karma.
Burn reward for pink diamond will match ruby.

Market price change
Market will be reset.
Rubies will no longer be available in market.
Pink diamonds will cost the same as diamonds to buy.

Rarity effects.
Wishlist character's rate will be boosted scaling with number of diamonds and pink diamonds for stellarites.

Standard Gacha changes
Main and side character pool merged to "core".
Extra will be changed to use all cards as the pool.
Wishlist rate boost set to 0 for base and increased with number of diamonds and pink diamonds in your list for stellarite only.
*main and wishlist was too powerful, while good for personal collection, it was too easy to get characters you want.
While retaining some of the previous effect for rarity that really matters (stellarite) I hope this change promotes gifting and trading.

Karma gacha changes
Karma gacha cost increased.
Lapis removed from karma gacha rarity.
*TBD from below for karma gacha changes
- Reduce wishlist rate to 50% and introduce core pool as the other 50%.
- If you acquire a stellarite that isn't in your wishlist, your next stellarite wishlist rate will be 100%.
- Introducing stellarite pity.

Gift
Stellarite cards can no longer be gifted.

Trade
Stellarite cards can only be traded if both sides have equal number of stellarite cards in the trade.
Otherwise, equivelant cost in coins will be transferred.
Ascended cards cannot be traded.

Level
Level cap introduced. Default is 10.
Reaching level cap unlocks prestige.

Prestige
Resets inventory, gems, karma, and money to starting value.*
Increases level cap by 5.
Unlocks command ascend.

Ascend
Merges two stellarite with matching character into one.
Prevents the stellarite from being removed from prestige.*
Adds a counter to list view.
Viewing a card allows you to cycle through an album of customisable image.
Album size increases with counter.

*First prestige will reset your inventory, but from second prestige on you get to keep your ascended stellarites.
**I'm aware you'll be able to buy back some stellarites eventually by trading and gifting.
***Yeah you can trade/gift around diamonds for boosted rate but I think that'll be ok for the most part.

PVP. 
Current version is playable and if you have time I'd like you to give it a go.
I'd like some feedback and opinions
Potential plans if it seems promising and there's value in continued developement.
Weapons will be a separate gacha and collection, and you'll be able to equip and unequip from cards.
Will not be reset from prestige.
Will drop rewards and xp.
